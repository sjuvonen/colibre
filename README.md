Colibre
=======

Colibre is an experimental CMS because I don't care much about building my personal website on top
of someone else's code. This is the second iteration, building on Node.js's module system* and 
utilizing recent improvements in JavaScript feature-set.

(*) As of now, however, all the code is contained in this repo, each sub-directory being its own module.
