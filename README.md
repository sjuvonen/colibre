# Colibre

Colibre is an experimental CMS / framework written from scratch. It is a personal experiment and not necessarily targeting mainstream fame. 

This is the third iteration, building on ever-improving Node.js's most recent features and my lack of recollection of what was wrong with the previous version(s).

The design is modular but right now all code is contained in a single repository.
